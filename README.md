# ChatBot-RoboTutor

Hey fellow robot enthusiasts! âœ¨

I'm excited to share about my first chatbot creation: RoboTutor!
Built using the amazing Stack AI platform, RoboTutor is one-stop shop for all things about robots, sensors, and actuators.
Simply ask RoboTutor a question through its user-friendly interface, and it will readily access and process information from a vast knowledge base.
It is still in its initial stages and I developed it as a mini project , really excited to work on it in future!
Robo Tutor is a chat bot that gives you all the information related to Robotics ,sensors and actuators.
